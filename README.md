=====================

Introduction
------------

A python module to perform simple pattern matching on (relative) paths.

Information about this module can be found here:

* [github.com](https://github.com/jkpubsrc/python-module-jk-pathpatternmatcher)
* [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/jk_pathpatternmatcher/)

How to use this module
----------------------

### Import

To import this module use the following statement:

```python
import jk_pathpatternmatcher
```

### Matching Patterns

The function ```createPatternMatcher``` will compile a string or a list of strings and provide a pattern matcher object.
This object contains the method ```checkMatch(...)``` for checking against strings. Example:

```python
matcher = jk_pathpatternmatcher.createPatternMatcher('someDir/**/myFile.*.txt')
bResult = matcher.checkMatch("someDir/someOtherDir/evenAnotherDir/myFile.extra.txt')
```

### Iterating over Files and Directories

For processing files and directories the following function exists for your convenience:

```python
#
# Recursively get all files and directories. If a filter is specified the filter is taken into account.
#
# @param		str bRecursive				The base path that defines the starting point for the search.
# @param		bool bRecursive				If <c>True</c> (= the default) a recursive search will be performed.
# @param		misc relDirPathFilter		A filter specifying which directories to ignore.
# @param		misc relFilePathFilter		A filter specifying which files to ignore.
# @return		tuple						Returns a tuple containing:
#											* a list of directory paths relative to the search base directory
#											* a list of file paths relative to the search base directory
#
def getFilesAndDirs(searchBaseDirPath, relDirPathFilter, relFilePathFilter, bRecursive = True)
```
